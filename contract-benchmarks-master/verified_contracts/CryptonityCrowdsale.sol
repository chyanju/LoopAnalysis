 * @title String & slice utility library for Solidity contracts.
 * @author Nick Johnson <<span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="52332033313a3c3b36123c3d26363d267c3c3726">[email protected]</span>&gt;&#13;
 *&#13;
 * @dev Functionality in this library is largely implemented using an&#13;
 *      abstraction called a 'slice'. A slice represents a part of a string -&#13;
 *      anything from the entire string to a single character, or even no&#13;
 *      characters at all (a 0-length slice). Since a slice only has to specify&#13;
 *      an offset and a length, copying and manipulating slices is a lot less&#13;
 *      expensive than copying and manipulating the strings they reference.&#13;
 *&#13;
 *      To further reduce gas costs, most functions on slice that need to return&#13;
 *      a slice modify the original one instead of allocating a new one; for&#13;
 *      instance, `s.split(".")` will return the text up to the first '.',&#13;
 *      modifying s to only contain the remainder of the string after the '.'.&#13;
 *      In situations where you do not want to modify the original slice, you&#13;
 *      can make a copy first with `.copy()`, for example:&#13;
 *      `s.copy().split(".")`. Try and avoid using this idiom in loops; since&#13;
 *      Solidity has no memory management, it will result in allocating many&#13;
 *      short-lived slices that are later discarded.&#13;
 *&#13;
 *      Functions that return two slices come in two versions: a non-allocating&#13;
 *      version that takes the second slice as an argument, modifying it in&#13;
 *      place, and an allocating version that allocates and returns the second&#13;
 *      slice; see `nextRune` for example.&#13;
 *&#13;
 *      Functions that have to copy string data will return strings rather than&#13;
 *      slices; these can be cast back to slices for further processing if&#13;
 *      required.&#13;
 *&#13;
 *      For convenience, some functions are provided with non-modifying&#13;
 *      variants that create a new slice and return both; for instance,&#13;
 *      `s.splitNew('.')` leaves s unmodified, and returns two values&#13;
 *      corresponding to the left and right parts of the string.&#13;
